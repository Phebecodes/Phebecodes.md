# About me
This is a personal repository, where I document my labs and hands-on practicals.

I enjoy learning and practicing what I've learned. I'm currently learning to use some SOC analysis tools -Brim, Wireshark, Snort, Zeek- on tryhackme. 
I'm also currently taking the google cybersecurity professional certificate course on coursera, and I'll be documenting my projects here.

When I'm not working at my day job, or practicing cybersecurity, I love to read books, novels mostly and watch youtube videos on finance.
